Fully typechecking a mod form goes in 4 passes:

1: which types exist? are they aliases or newtypes?
   Don't expand them.
   Corresponds to the ec relation: ⊢≫type-decl

2: expand the types to find what they are equal to,
   check to rule out recursion and mutual recursion between type aliases
   Corresponds to the ec relation: ⊢≫type-def

3: which vals exist? what are their types?
   Don't expand them, don't check subtypes, etc.
   Corresponds to the ec relation: ⊢≫val-decl

4. expand the vals and type check them, including checking subtypes
   Corresponds to the ec relations: ⊢≫⇒
                                    ⊢≫⇐
